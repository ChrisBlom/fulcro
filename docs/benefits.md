# The Benefits of Fulcro

In a nutshell: Fulcro eliminates a lot of incidental complexity.

It allows you to think
about rendering as a pure function of data, which then allows you to think about the
clean evolution of your data model from one state to the next through *mutations* on that
data model (atomic steps that complete one operation). The UI pretty much takes care
of itself.

We understand that it is hard for you to take our word for it, but framework
evaluation does require the reader to put in some effort. However, we also
understand you're busy, so in the interest of giving you some talking points:

## Why to Use Fulcro

- *Dramatically* reduce the amount of code you have to write. Fulcro apps are
a *lot* smaller than the equivalent React/Relay/Redux variant.
- Most asynchrony evaporates! Callbacks? We (mostly) don't need them.
- Use an advanced, fast, FP language on both the client and server.
- Reason about the UI as a pure function (no "bit twiddling" to modify the DOM).
- Reason about the data model as a pure graph of data (mostly separate from the UI).
    - Data ends up in easy-to-access linked table-like structures that make understanding and updating the data easy.
- Clean, unit-testable *mutations* evolve the data model. The UI takes care of itself through two easy to understand
mechanisms (no two-way data binding causing (or failing to cause) storms of refreshes):
    - The UI refreshes anything that triggers a mutation whose data has actually changed.
    - Through listing (abstractly) what data in the model a mutation affects.
- One langauge is used on both client and server. Like node, but without the Javascript.
- A full-stack story that unifies how your model is treated on both the client and server.
- It is [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-based: The rendering itself is done by a widely used, supported, and robust library.
- The data and communication model is similar to that of GraphQL and Falcor, but simplified via a concise Datomic-like graph query language.
    - Read about [data driven architectures](https://medium.com/@env/demand-driven-development-relay-falcor-om-next-75818bd54ea1).
    - The model makes [CQRS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNPQo9UmJA) pretty easy to add for both auditing and performance.
- It has a strong FP flair:
    - Rendering is done as a pure function.
    - No in-place mutation (persistent data structures).
    - UI History and time travel are supported features (including a support UI VCR).
- It leverages Google Closure for js optimization, so you get these for free (with little headache):
    - Dynamic module loading (code splitting)
    - Minification
    - Dead code elimination
    - A large library of reusable functions (Google's Closure library)
- UI in React + cljc means that client and server-side rendering of initial loads is easy to get.
- You get to think of your application almost completely as a pure data model.
- A gettext-based internationalization system.
- Meta-programming is quite powerful when used well (think of building a DSL that can then be used to build
elements of your program). Clojure is homoiconic, making this easier.

## When not to Use Fulcro

Fulcro does try to provide you with a full-stack story. It also requires that you learn
(and *unlearn*) a few things that some people find initially challenging. Here are some reasons
you might *not* want to use Fulcro:

- You are writing a game. Fulcro shines when it comes to data-driven applications. Games typically need very fast
  framerates and low UI overhead. Fulcro is fast enough for data-driven apps, but it really would not make
  sense for animation-heavy gaming.
- You don't want to learn something radically different from what you're used to.
- Your co-workers don't want to learn something radically different.
- Your company cannot be convinced that the long-term benefits of Fulcro will pay off in the long run compared to the
costs of re-training/tooling.
