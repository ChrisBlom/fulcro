                Fulcro provides a strongly cohesive story that has many advantages over techniques, libraries, and
                frameworks you might have used before.

            <p>
                Fulcro is a full-stack library that is aimed at making data-driven applications for the web. The
                built-in data model prevents many
                common errors that are made when assembling your tools from invented or selected parts.

            <p>Concentrate on solving your real application problems. Other systems weigh you down with asynchrony,
                event systems,
                callback hell, and REST APIs. Fulcro gives you much simpler constructs as a foundation.</p>

            There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVi9lDx-4C_Rwb8LUwW4AdjAu-39PHgEE">YouTube
            video
            playlist</a> of relatively short videos that can help you get started quickly and often clarifies things
            that people struggle with.
        </p>

        <p>
            Those who prefer to read should <i>still</i> check out the videos at some point, but should then
            proceed to a complete overview in the
            <a href="https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/blob/develop/GettingStarted.adoc"> Getting Started </a>
            guide. Those that like videos are encouraged to also read this guide.

        <p>
            There is also a playlist of <a

            from when the project was known as Untangled. These videos are still relevant, and may lead to insight
            by exposing you to different angles of the same topic. For the most part just substitute "Fulcro" every
            time you see or hear "Untangled".

        Evaluating tools for web development can be a monumental task. Fulcro is a
        full-stack, batteries-included library that is aimed at making data-driven
        applications for the web. It enables great local reasoning, easy production
        support, and rapid development. Of course, it is hard to make such a
        big decision on a simple list of "features", nor should you!

        </p>
        <p>
        Each set of tools have particular strengths that may or may not be a good fit.
        To help you evaluate it, you might want to:

            We started our product with re-frame, but as it grew the ease of re-frame turned
            into complexity in our application, resulting in lot's of bugs and inefficiencies.
            When we ported to Fulcro many of our bugs and inefficiencies were completely solved by
            the solid data model and full-stack integration.
        </p>
        <p class="green">Mitchel Kuijpers</p>
        <p class="p1">Fulcro is the best web framework for using Lisp in 2016. It's for building robust applications and
            solving difficult problems, not building a mediocre blog in a weekend. At AdStage it was
            our first full stack Clojure project and it took 3 developers 4 months to deliver the
            smoothest launch in our company's history. </p>
        <p class="green">Karan Toor</p>
        <p class="p1">With Fulcro all the plumbing is built-in, and I'm impressed on how
            often my assumptions match with their implementation. Because of this I can focus on the specifics of the
            application.
