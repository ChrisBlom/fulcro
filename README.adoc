Fulcro 2.0 is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React, is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript (so it has first-class functional abilities with immutable data) which leads to a very clean
synchronous story for the UI. The result is a stack that dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate and incidental complexity
in your software.

Fulcro 1.0 is still supported but is only getting bug fix releases at this point. Version 1.0 was an
add-on library for Om Next. Fulcro 2.0 no longer has a dependency on Om Next, though the surface API
is still very similar. See link:/README-fulcro-2.0.adoc[README-fulcro-2.0.adoc] for porting instructions and the reasoning behind the change.

## IMPORTANT NOTE: Documentation Update In Progress

Fulcro documentation is undergoing an update for 2.0. YouTube videos and other documentation on this website may still refer to 1.0 things.
. You can find consistent 1.x documentation here:
http://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/guide-v1.html.
YouTube videos all still refer to version 1.x, as do many of the aux github repositories.
We expect this to normalize again by December 12th or so.

## Writing Applications with Fulcro

The https://fulcrologic.github.io/fulcro[website] is a great place to read about
Fulcro. It has pages describing things in more general terms, and has links
to various resources like videos and evaluation guides.

If you want to jump and code, read on!

### Getting Started

See link:/GettingStarted.adoc[GettingStarted.adoc] to get going. It covers all of the
basics related to full-stack development in Fulcro.

There is a `lein` template, which emits a bare-bones full-stack app with dev, testing, 
uberjar, i18n, and devcards support.

```
lein new fulcro my-project
```

If you don't know Clojure, you should at least get comfortable with the basics.
I recommend: http://www.braveclojure.com/[Clojure for the Brave and True], and doing at least the
basic online exercises at http://www.4clojure.com/[4Clojure]. You should also have
a passing familiarity with Facebook's React, though if you understand that we're
using it to get "fast UI updates", that is sufficient to start.

### Developer's Guide

The Developer's Guide is really an interactive coding tutorial using Devcards. You
can view an http://fulcrologic.github.io/fulcro/guide.html[online version],
but in order to use it properly you should clone Fulcro and:

```
./run-devguide.sh
```

and follow the instructions.

## See Some Demos

There are a number of demos that show how particular common things are done with Fulcro. To view them:

- Use git to clone this repository
- Use the `run-demos.sh` shell script at the top of the project and follow the instructions it gives.

This compiles the demos, and runs a server that can respond to the full-stack examples.

NOTE: A number of things might use the network port of the demo server, so don't try to do this while also
doing something else in the project.

## Contributors

Fulcro is maintained by Fulcrologic, LLC. The primary architect and maintainer is Tony Kay.

Fulcro expands on the work of David Nolen's Om Next, and that code represents about 30% of 2.0's code base.
Much of the core API is similar, but this
library is intended to be an easier-to-use alternative that follows the original simplicity of design while eliminating
some experimental features of that library, and rounding out the story with a complete concrete implementation
that is easy to use.

Many people have contributed to this library. Much of the original internal work was part of Om Next and
as written by David Nolen. Some of the contributions of Antonio Monteiro have also been incorporated.

Fulcro itself originated as an effort of Navis in Bend, Oregon. Tony Kay was the primary architect, and numerous people
contributed in that original project (known as Untangled).

Fulcro can therefore be considered a fork of Untangled and Om Next.

See the github statistics for information on all contributors.
